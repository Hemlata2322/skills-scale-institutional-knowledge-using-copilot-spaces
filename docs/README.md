# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README summarizes the project management processes used by OctoAcme and provides quick links to detailed documentation in the docs/ folder.

## Brief Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach focused on clear ownership and measurable outcomes. Key principles:

- Customer-first delivery and clear ownership: Decisions prioritize customer value; each initiative has a named owner.
- Iterative and incremental planning/execution: Work is planned in short increments to deliver value early and gather feedback.
- Milestone-driven tracking and demos: Progress is tracked by milestones with regular demos to stakeholders.
- Proactive risk management and escalation: Risks are identified early, mitigated, and escalated when needed.
- Continuous improvement: Retrospectives and metrics drive process refinement and learning.
- Defined roles: Product, Project, and Development leads have clear responsibilities for scope, schedule, and delivery.
